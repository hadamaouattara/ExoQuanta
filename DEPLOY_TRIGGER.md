ðŸš€ **FORCE NETLIFY REBUILD - TIMESTAMP: 2025-08-21 06:21:15 UTC**

This commit forces a fresh Netlify deployment after fixing the critters module error.

## Recent Fixes Applied:
âœ… Removed experimental `optimizeCss: true` from next.config.js
âœ… Fixed critters module dependency issue  
âœ… Build should now complete successfully
âœ… Site should display Exonov Quantum app (not Netlify template)

Expected result: https://exoquanta.netlify.app should show the full Exonov Quantum application.
