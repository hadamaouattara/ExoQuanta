## Fix CSS Loading Issue

This commit addresses the CSS not loading properly by:

1. **Downgrading Tailwind CSS from v4 to v3** - The project was using v4 packages but v3 configuration
2. **Adding PostCSS config** - Required for Tailwind v3 to process CSS properly  
3. **Ensuring compatibility** - All CSS directives now match the package versions

The site should now display the proper quantum interface with gradients and styling.

**Files changed:**
- package.json: Tailwind v4 â†’ v3, added autoprefixer
- postcss.config.js: Added proper PostCSS configuration
- CSS should now load correctly on all pages

**Expected result:** Beautiful quantum interface restored
